# Repeat-Buyers-Prediction

The problem that we discussed in this project is called “Repeat Buyers Prediction-Challenge the Baseline”, which is about prediction in business field. To attract more buyers and make huge profits, merchants used to run a big promotion on special dates, such as “Black Friday” and “Double Eleven”. However, regard of the history, this promotion method has little impact on long-term sales since most of buyers at “Double Eleven” would not become the loyal buyers of this particular store. We want to discuss a baseline that aims to predict that who would be the loyal buyers on specific store in the future based on customers’ purchase records on “Double Eleven” and the past. Merchants are supposed to greatly reduce the promotion cost and enhance the return on
investment (ROI) by redesigning the promotion plan that more suitable for those loyal buyers predicted by the model. Since in our prediction results, 0-1 label would be used to define whether buyer would
purchase in the future, basically it is a binary classification problem in machine learning.
Solving this problem was supposed to be a great chance for me to enhance abilities of data analytics by
using machine learning models. XGBoost is a model widely used in binary classification. It was used in
this repeat-buyers prediction. We also coordinated features of models to our particular problem and
compared the performance of these two models.
